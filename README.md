# Sass template for ICJ lesson

This repo is a template used in the [Intro to Coding for Journalists book](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class/) chapter on Sass.

## Project setup with degit

An easy way to download and use a repo as a template is [degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit), which ICJ students should have installed when they set up Node. It downloads the contents of a repo but without the `.git` folder.

- Create your local project folder.
- In a terminal from inside the folder, run `degit utdata/icj-sass-template`.
- Run `npm install` to install dependences.
- Run `gulp dev` to run Sass and start the development server.

You'll need to create your own local and Github repos.

For further directions, see the Sass lessons in the [ICJ class](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class/) book.
